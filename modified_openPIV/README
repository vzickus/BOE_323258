corr_average_modificaiton_main_file.py contains the modified OpenPIV code for
the zebrafish heart PIV analysis of frames with z and phase information.

loading_and_piv_funcs_new.py is a "helper" module for the above script.

NOTE: since the first vesrion of the paper, the PIV analysis now
adds an extra "padding" of 0 values around the raw data, to allow
for inserting an extra interrogation window, which allows 
to investigate features near the boundaries of the region
of interest. The padding is half the large IW dimension, and
if using old results, this should be taken into account when 
comparing resutls.
